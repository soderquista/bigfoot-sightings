She had been good about picking out Antelope, Deer, and a Grizzly bear on earlier days during our trip. We were proceeding up the mountain pass, and were in the middle of the switchbacks when my wife saw what she described as \\\"A man in dark clothes\\\" on the side of the road on an upcoming part of the pass. She was visibly surprised that the \\\"Man\\\" was not there as we turned the corner where he would have been. There were steep cliffs on each side of the road, with no turnouts and very little shoulder. She told me that she was paying attention as we rounded the switchback were he would have been so she could warn me about the man on the side of the road.\",\n",

I worked in the coal mines near a small town called Amigo. What I used to do (my job description) was coal sampler. I would drive around all day collecting coal for chemical analysis, from the high walls to the deep mine. The deep mine is more remote since they just put the belt head in. It is so far from the plant to the deep mines it would take me about 30 to 35 minutes driving in the mountains. Last week I was driving back from picking up a sample and noticed something running back up in the woods. It was two does. Then I noticed something was laying on the ground. I beeped my horn thinking it was a bob cat and up jumped this light tan (just a little bit darker than the deers skin) thing. I froze. It was definitely wasn't a man or bear. All I know is it was walking upright. It did something that looked like it clapped its hands.  Then I watched it kneel down and crawl into an airshaft for an abandonned mine. To my surprise, another one appeared out of nowhere and ran past it. I could tell this one was only a couple inches taller than me (6-7). I do know it was something Iâ€™ve never seen before.

We all enjoy observing the local flora and fauna in their natural settings and we often drive and/or walk the back roads looking for deer, moose, bear and whatever else we can spot. One evening we went \\\"Moose Spotting\\\" on Tyson Road since during a summer trip to the same area, earlier, we had observed eight moose in one evening. As we drove along Tyson Road I saw a large bipedal form cross the road in two strides. I asked one of my daughters, \\\"Did you see that? Tell me what did you see.\\\" I purposely didn't say what I'd seen since I wanted to know if she'd seen what I'd seen. I wanted to be sure I had not imagined it. Very quickly she said, \\\"I don't know what it was but it was real big, maybe eight feet tall, hairy and crossed the road in two steps.\\\" She saw the same thing I did.  It crossed the road about 50 feet ahead of us and judging from the trees where it crossed the road I'd say her height estimate is accurate +/- 20%. My other daughter didn't see it since she was in the back seat and was looking out the side windows of the car. I still don't quite believe it but I know what bear, deer and moose look like in natural settings since I've been hunting for 40 years. It wasn't anything I had ever seen in the woods. It walked across the road in two strides, was heavily built, covered in short dark hair and, as stated previously, approximately eight  feet tall. One more thing.  The day before, we had driven the same area, didn't see anything at all, no fauna at all, but we did hear some very odd vocalizations that sound very much like the recordings available on your website.\",\n",

When we got about half way through Virginia I was just looking out the window, bored of course,  then bam! Just like that I see this large hairy black creature walking in the woods in between the trees about 20 or 30 yards away from the road I believe. At first I thought I was losing my mind and it didnt make any sense to see something that should not exist. I was blown away.  It just walked along un-disturbed by the moving cars. My younger brother looked and saw the creature moving along as well. When I saw this creature I finally blurted out Bigfoot! My dad had his eyes on the road and thought we were joking or something. I will never forget that day and as far as I am concerned bigfoot is very much a reality. It looked very much like the bigfoot in the Patterson film almost identical I would say. The creature was a classic giant ape that looked heavy. About 8 feet tall and weighing upwards of 500 pounds I suppose. It had a very long stride with arms swaying back and forth and its head a little bit lowered, it really did look very similar to the bigfoot in the 67' Patterson film. The hair was jet black head to toe, I couldnt make out any facial features. I asked my brother about this the other day (he lives in Georgia), he said he saw the same thing but not in the detail I did because we were cruising along at 60mph, but my brother said it was very large, black, stood upright and was moving along.\",\n",

We walked down a path that was used by a farmer to get to his pasture were he had cattle grazing. As we walked down the path I felt as though we were being watched. It was an eerie feeling that still haunts me to this day as I recall the incident. Off to my left and approximately 30 to 40 yards away, and 50 or so yards from the main road, was a hairy creature standing in a bent over slump raking it's arms through a patch of May apple. My brother saw it at about the same time. At that moment the two of us ran as fast as we could not looking at each other, but looking at the creature over our shoulders. I was afraid that it would come after us, but it stood in the patch of May apple looking at us as though it didn't know what to make of us. I have told this story many times since that day. Many people laugh in disbelief, but I know what I saw and it could only be one of two things. Either someone dressed in a Bigfoot costume, or it was Bigfoot himself.\",\n",

During the fall, both sides of that hollow bear wild grapes/scuffonons.  My mother, Joyce, had asked me to ride up the road to get my fathers paper.  You see I had forgotten after the school bus dropped me off to pick up the Evening Herald.  Any way I got on my Red Murray Bike and rode up the road.  My plot hound, Butler, plodded along beside of me.  As I biked up the road, the forest is on my left, field on my right, I began to notice a smell berry similar to a yard that has been freshly cut with wild onions growing in it.  My dog noticed it first and began to slow down At was then that I looked into the hollow and saw what has changed my life from that moment on. The creature stood about as tall as a small shed and was very large.  It was covered with a light brown hair that showed up amber like an aurora around its body when the sun hit it.  The face was very much like a Mongoloid man, and the eyes, hard to tell, brown.  It was eating grapes and its teeth were yellowish.  My dog left at this point and went back toward the house.  It looked at me moved in my direction in a curious notion.  I became scared and left towards home.  I did look back to see it lumber over the fence.  It came out of the forest only briefly and went back.  My uncle was the only one who saw it again after that.\",\n",

      "  \"observed\": \"While attending U.R.I in the Fall of 1974,I would stay at my girlfriends mother's house on weekends because I only had a five day mealbook plan. It was Sunday evening about 10:00pm when I decided to head back to school on my ten speed bike. Very dark in the area because it being mostly wooded, country like setting but yet city. I was going down her street and noticed my front center pull brake needed to be adjusted. I stopped under a street light at the end of her street which is an intersection to adjust the brake. Directly in front of me was a small field that sloped down and away from me,pitch black background, tall grass and a few bushes being light by the street light. Typical New England, Oak, Maple and, Pine trees. As I was fixing my brake I began hearing very loud foot steps of a biped, comig from the field on the slope side,more like a crushing thud. I could hear the actual compression being placed, like someone dropping a heavy metal ball/rock on the ground.I looked up to see if I could see anything and just said to myself \\\"its nothing\\\", and went back to fixing my brake. I noticed it was getting closer and felt very apprehensive, the sound was coming in my direction. All of sudden this dog starts barking like crazy, I can hear the chain snap as it either tries to attack or getaway from something. I said to myself \\\"its time to go!\\\", as I started I turned left to head north, into a few pedals. From out of the darkness steps into the street light this white looking gorilla. The legs present themselves then the body as it comes to rest on its knuckles. Twenty maybe twenty five feet away, directly across the street from me perhads six feet tall maybe 400 pounds or more. Massive arms that went straight down on its knuckles, knees slight bent.The head is higher in the back connected to the neck all-in-one mass. The face dark, deep strong  but primate.The eyes are close together and set deep in the face. The nose and mouth are human like, it's nose is wide, around the mouth black hair that went down on each side.It looks up with its head and chest see me, eyeball to eyeball as I look back trying to see if this thing is real. Humanlike in appearance, the face is not like a primate but has a distinct animal presence (the eye are close together). I was never so scared in my life and knew had I stayed I don't think I would of survived the attack.The way it was positioned gave it an explosive start as it decides to chase me down the street. My heart was pounding out of my chest, my eyes had tears in them and with all my might I pedaled as it ran on two legs, then down on its knuckles then back up again. Perhaps for ten yards, I remember how its long hair on its arms moved with each reach,I thank god I was in first gear. A good five second chase and it was all over.It had stopped in the middle of the street just swaying back and forth, turned and just cleared this rock wall all in one motion from a grass sidewalk. At the top of hill I began riding in circles, I didn't know what to do, I could not comprehend the situation I was in. I knew one thing I was not riding back. I cut through her grandmother's yards and made it back to her house. Not trying to look crazy or anything they ask me what's wrong ? I told them what happened and agreed  that it was best to go back in the morning.\",\n",

      "  \"observed\": \"Hello, My name is Doug and though I am very reluctant to post this story; I am going to do so anyways. The area that this happened  could not be a more unlikely area for a bigfoot occurance then or  especially now with all the development of the farmland in the last 25 years which has been extensive and at a phenominal rate. After reading many (if not every last report on this website) and coming across more that a few that have happened in improbable areas (bigfoot running down neighborhood streets and sightings/ vocalizations near condo areas), I decided there just might be some merit in submitting this for review. A skilled researcher might be able to shed some more light maybe. My friends parents owned a small somewhat defunct farm with (I'm guessing maybe 15-20 acres of land -not the best judge on that) They had 3 horses; 2 mares that were allowed out in the field areas; a stabled stallion, and a pony I believe. The barn was in dis-repair and part of the roof had collapsed years earlier. There was a large pond that was almost completely enclosed with an impenatrable thicket of briars ringing almost the whole cirmcuference of the pond, except for a small area that was kept open for access for the horses to water. Much of the property was overgrown with these same briars that tended to make big circular mounds here and there in the field. The house sat close to the road; the barn to the left and further behind. The extreme left side of their property was bordered by a small stream that edged along a small (100 ft x 30 ft) stand of very dense pine trees. These pines (species unknown) tend to have a very dense understory of almost horizontal dead, dry, branches due to years of growth an minimal sunlight. The lower end of this pine grove had a mowed lawn area (next door neighbors property who were also related to my friend family) You had to access the camping area through the neighbors propery as the overgrowth of briars and other weeds, brambles, trees made it impossible to get there directly for the E------- property. The pond in relation to the campsite was to the left if you were looking back up towards the road; with the stream running between. The dense pine grove then lay between you and the road; unless you skirted around it through the neigbors backyard. This is what happened. No sighting but a vocalization. We had gone down to the campsite had built a fire and been down there for about an hour. During this time we all felt uneasy even though we had been there before many times. This is a long time ago but to the best of my memory we had been joking; probably made something to eat over the fire but something felt really wrong this time. \\\"Wrong\\\" is the best word I can use to describe. I remember I felt like I couldn't just sit down by the fire and stay with the conversation though. From back in the pine grove was the occasional, deliberate braking of branches that were just a little too large (to the sophisticated human ear) and just had the sound of being \\\"up off the ground some ways\\\" This would start and stop. We would listen and comment on it. First we thought maybe the mares had gotten back into the woods, unusual but this later was confirmed not to be so because we found out the next day that they were stabled for the night. We then thought it might be some older boys who were trying to scare us into running. It would be quiet for awhile then there would be a sense of movement closer to where we were and then receeding. We shined a flashlight and ventured back alittle ways but saw or smelled nothing. The sounds began again this time definately agitated, insistent with a very permiable feeling. We started to get un-nerved  moved out into the neighbors backyard. The sound grew louder, with traceable movement and then this ear splitting scream cut right out into the night. One loud shriek louder than anything should have to be. It just cut right to the core of your soul. Like so many reports I've read on this website, it's virtually impossible to do it justice with a human description precisly because it sounded so inhuman. We just ran like hell back to the house, left everything behind. No sense of being followed at all. No visual sighting (I almost wish). No bad smells or odors. In terms of other reports this pales, I know. But this is what happened and I never forgot it. We knew what Sasquatch were at the time, but no one ever heard of sightings east of the Mississippi to the best of my memory then. We kind of joked that maybe that's what our unseen friend was. Years later when I read and saw the reports from the southern part of York County (report on file with your website.) did I ever give any serious thought.\",\n",

      "  \"location_details\": \"I would rather not have exact location (listing the nearest road) to repect the privacy of the family that still owns the property. I have long since had a falling out with my friend at the time and don't feel he or they would like being approache about this. I like my own privacy respected; so I must accord others the same. The general area at that time was more open farmland with some large housing developements (in which I lived) within a mile. There were a good deal of homes scattered here and there and others in smaller developments. A very large animal like a Sasquatch could conceivably navigate (migrate) through an area like this at night using farmland as cover; but absolutely not stay very long in an area like that even then without revealing it's presense. I can give you more specific details on topography. Farmland opens up eventually much more to the north with a State Park (Gifford Pinchot) at the north end of the county. Southern end of York county where the  sightings occurred is a more likely area given in terms of what I've read of similar topography of other sighting then. Also much more rural and forested in the early \\\"70's.\",\n",

Not a coyote, bear or cougar. Have heard all of them before. This was nothing like anything I have ever heard. I still remember thinking to myself \\\"How in the hell can something make such a low howl.\\\" It scared us at first, but is sounded like it was far away, like maybe a mile or so. We were drinking a little beer, so after awhile we relaxed and forgot about it. It must have been about a half hour later when we heard it again. I swear that it had to be within 30 yards of us. Same loud, low howl, but MUCH closer. And it sounded pissed. I could feel the sound vibrations bouncing off the back of my neck. The hair stood up on the back of all of our necks. All of us turned white as hell, and our jaws dropped past our knees. The howl seemed to say \\\"GET OUT!\\\" Which is EXACTLY what we did. I just looked at the two other guys and said \\\"lets get the @#$ outta here \\\". We did not see anything, but felt the presence. I grew up within 10 miles of that spot. I had never heard that sound before, or since, EXCEPT on a television show that had a report of a bigfoot sighting. A guy in Idaho caught one on video (at least it looked like one), but when I saw the video, I heard that scream again. The guy taking the video threw the camera in the ditch, and hid. It was the SAME scream. ONLY other time that I have EVER heard it. It was EXACTLY the same scream. I saw this video on a news show, something like \\\"Real TV\\\" while in Fairfax, VA, in 1992 or 1993. I do not know EXACTLY what it is that we heard, but I know what I think it was. Bigfoot. That is my story, and I have two wittnesses to back me up.\",\n",

I was driving and my son (age 11) was sitting in the front seat beside me and my daughter (age 12) was sitting in the back seat leaning forward between the driver and passenger seat. It was a clear sunny day about 3 PM and there was a lull in the conversation. It was quiet in the car, we did not have the radio on and all three of us were happened to be looking straight ahead. I noticed a movement on the left side of the road and was amazed to see a what I percieved to be a very large black man-like creature rise from a squatting position and run across the two lane highway about 30 yards ahead. It ran across the highway, covering the distance in only three steps, I estimate the creature to have been at least 8 feet tall, it glanced briefly in the direction of the car and I instictively applied the brake so as not to hit it. It ran into the bar ditch on the east side of the road and ducked into some brush and large bushes between the ditch and the barbed wire fence. It had hair that looked rather silky as it ran, I remember seeing the hair move as it ran. The hair did not appear to be stiff like an animals hair but more soft and shiny. Both children saw it too and said \\\"What was that, mama?\\\" I said I didn't know, they wanted me to stop the car, but I was frightened that my children and I could be harmed by something I had never seen before in my life. I didn't tell anyone what I had seen and cautioned the children not to say anything either.\",\n",

      "  \"observed\": \"Well last year I was night fishing 9/2010 at Amawalk Reservior SOMERS NY about 30 minutes from PAWLINGS I was fishing with my buddy..the reservior was about 100ft into the lake before you got to water .....about 5am sun was coming out..when a 5 foot maybe 5 1/2 ft man  or Big Foot came out of the woods washed its face and drank some of the reservoir water..he looked like something out of the old school \\\"Planets of the Apes\\\" chimps..I said to my buddy \\\"you see that?\\\"?he said yes ..Now on Animal Planet there showing a clip of a Big Foot that has been seen in these areas (Lower Hudson Valley)..So I'm puzzled to think what I saw was a Big Foot....so this my account of what I saw..and we didn't catch crap at night..anybody ever run into anything like this??... This was my post on www.westchesterfishing.com Low and be hold another member at the same reservior..Columbus day 2011..this is his post..Hey Guys, I put at Amawalk this summer and about the 5th time I took it out in early October.  I saw two upright walking chimp looking things walk out of the woods and crouch down and drink from the res, run back in to the woods and then do the same thing again.  When they came out the second time one of them threw it's arms in the air while squatting and then they ran back into the woods.   The second one went back slowly.  It seemed like they saw something in the water right in front of them.  That was right when the sun came up.  I haven't been back to my boat since.  I have no idea what they were and looked like two large chimps to me.  Maybe some guy who lives there has two monkeys or something?  I have no idea.  But I saw something that I can't explain, it has been eating away at me since.  When I saw the preview for that show I almost shat myself.  When Biggame posted here I didn't want to say that I saw something because I'm from Oregon and my hunting and logging part of the family thinks they know where they live but none of them have never ever seen them just have stories, just like everyone else in Oregon.  Then I saw what I saw in October and have been denying it to myself ever since.  I absolutely hope that someone owns two monkey's on the Amawalk. I have no reason to say something like this.  Before October I could have cared less if bigfoot existed, now I'm a bit curious.  I own a fishing rod company and have business to lose from people thinking I'm crazy for posting this on here.  This is a nothing to gain and allot to lose situation for me but, I had to say something when Biggame posted.  Let me be clear in saying that I saw something too.  I have no idea what they were and would need absolute proof that bigfoot existed before I would ever say thats what they were. So two seperate sightings same place different year..I BELIEVE!!!\",\n",

But anyway, we were playing in the yard it was close to getting dark but still daylight enough so that you could still see.  I don't quite remember if I heard a noise or what made me look across our road but when I looked, across the road on the edge of the woods I saw an image, similar to drawings I've seen of actual encounters.   It was walking at the edge of the woods kind of stooped over, using its hands to push the trees back out of its way.   All I could do was just stand there and look at it not really knowing what I was seeing.   I really don't know how long I stood there but I remember yelling at my sister who was then 7 years old, and telling her to run into the house.   She then looked and saw the same thing. As soon as I yelled at my sister it stopped dead in its tracks and just stood there and looked at us.   My sister and I still remember the feeling of not being able to move, and to this day we still get cold chills and our eyes water every time we talk about this. So anyway we eventually ran inside the house.  When we got in the house I remember my mom asking what was wrong because she said that both of us were as white as sheet.  We then went on to tell her what we had seen and were terrified to have her go outside  and check things out. Neither one of my parents ever saw anything but still to this day say they believe we did see something, whether it was someone playing a joke or possibly a bear but I still think to this day that it was Bigfoot or something similar.\",\n",

But I have never forgot what I saw. It was strong and tall but not real tall.  Maybe six foot ten to seven feet tall. It had a smell to him I will never forget. I knew he was still there down in the hollow where I was raised as a child. When we would cut firewood in the saw mill he would make us feel weird like he didn't want us there. My mom would say start the truck and don't stop until we get to the top of the ridge. We found footprints one winter that were very wide at the heel and very large in size like 17-20 inches long. I hope someone hears what I have to say. I would love to talk to someone about this. I know he is still there! It's a perfect place for him to live with so much forest and hills.\",\n",

I went to the fireworks in Beverly, Ohio and had met a young lady (sorry I don't recall her name) who was staying with some friends that lived near Churchtown. We watched the fireworks, then I offered to drive her home. I don't know the township road, but it is off state Route 676. We parked for a while then drove on to where she was staying. On the way to the house she had fallen asleep with her head in my lap, so she didn't see a thing. As I drove about 15 mph along these backroads, I rounded a slight turn where the banks on either side rose about six feet. On both sides of the road were fence and cornfields. Then, on the left side of the road behind the fence was a large hair covered, gray or white colored figure standing by the fence line. I was stunned and didn't say a word and just kept driving along slowly looking at this thing. As I went by it just looked at me. I didn't have a clue what to do, so I kept going. When I looked in the rear view mirror I saw it turn and go back into the cornfield. I didn't tell anyone for a while, but eventually told a couple friends who just smiled.\",\n",

We divided up in teams of two, my brothers were on a team and were going to go hide to which me and my cousin would try and find them after giving them some time to hide. We heard them scream and we stood up and were kinda worried because we were on the opposite side of the house than them. So we got up to make sure they were all right, but they came around the house before we could get to far. They went on to tell us that they heard something really big running in the thick patch of woods. My brother was going into the thicket to hide. When he started in that's when he heard something take off running. The sun was about to disappear as night grew nearer and he was still spooked from the noise he heard and refused to go hide anymore. I just thought that it was probably a deer since our area is very populated with them. So we got off the porch and was walking around the corner of the house when I looked up towards the road. Now to give you a brief description of the terrain. From where the thicket ends there is about 20 yards of short mowed grass which meets up with State Route 550 then on the other side of the road it slopes down fairly sharp and then into a cornfield. As it was striding across the road is where I saw it. It's arms were swaying back and forth and I remember the hair hanging from its arms. The body was very thick, thicker than any human body I've ever seen. The head looked like it ended in a point rather than a rounded head like a humans. It seemed to run in slow motion as I stood there in amazement. It went over the bank when it got to the other side of the road. We jumped up onto the porch and went inside to tell my dad. He just laughed at us and so have most people that I have told this to since then. I can still see that image in my head as if it just happened.\",\n",

After walking up several steep inclines and falling often we came up to another ridge that was very difficult to climb for us. We spotted a foot print actually my boyfriend did. I knew he had found something when he called for me to come quick and climb up the last area. I climbed up and there it was a foot print.  I did not really believe in Bigfoot but now we are having second thoughts. Mind you we drove two hours one way, and walked for at least hour up hill off the trails.  We even went back the next day which was today 11/1/09 and made a cast of the print. Of course it was not as deep as yesterday but we still took the print and have pictures from yesterday on the cell phone.\",\n",

      "  \"observed\": \"I've told very few people this story for fear that they might think I'm crazy. The only reason why I'm taking the time to report this is because of a recent entry a friend of mine who knew my story told me about. My story takes place in Charlestown, Rhode Island in the late 1970's. My mother and father and I lived in a wooded area abutting the \\\"Indian Cedar Swamp\\\" and property owned by United Nuclear which probably comprises several thousand acres. The property surrounding our home was mixed  white Atlantic juniper swamp,scarlet, red and white oaks with old growth white pine stands mixed in, with a dense understory of briars, mountain laurel and blue berry brush. We lived off a road with 3 houses on it. The houses were all built close to the entrance of this development. The road was part of a series of roads that were put in as the start of a development. The roads were oiled gravel and had been left to grow in after years of little or no use. It looked like the developer had started and went belly-up. These roads were great to ride bikes on or take a evening cruise on after bringing my father dinner at his second job. My mother drove a baby blue Mustang Mach 1 and she would drive around the roads with me looking at deer before we retired to our home for the evening. As a kid I remember this being a highlight to the evening. I was at the time maybe 8 years old and my mother and I on this particular night in the late 70's commenced our ride around the roads to see if we sould see any deer. It had been raining earlier with thunder and lightning mixed in. Now it was just raining. We were rounding a corner on one of the roads that paralleled the Indian Cedar Swamp and as we started downward,  we noticed the road was obstructed by a large blown down oak tree, the tree had green leaves (this makes me think it was summer or the early fall) on it so it had recently come down, we guessed maybe in the storm earlier(possibly lightning). The road was very narrow and the brush along the side of the road made it difficult to back the car around to turn around. The rain was falling but not heavy, the wipers were on, the headlights on the car were on as well. As my mother turned the front end  of the car the lights cast on the left side of the road where the tree had been broken off from its stump. We were maybe 1 1/2 car lengths from the stump. Beside the tall fractured stump stood what looked like a large white(yellow white) ape. It was maybe 6 to 7 feet tall, its hair was long, face flat, long massive arms, its head appeared to be without any neck, its chest was broad. My mother and I froze momentarily (5 seconds, maybe 10) and the figure remained still, staring at us. My mother floored the car into reverse. I remember ther terror of it all. The sound of gravel hitting inside the fender wells, the sound of the brush crushing against the car and then the acceleration as she sped off. We were clear as to what we saw and we have no question in our mind that we saw something or someone in ape like shape that night. This we are certain of. We need no one to tall us what we saw, it's crystal clear. For years we told no one. We would talk about it in our home in privacy and even my father found this story hard to accept. We've never forgotten this and this story would have never been told if it wasn't for someone else informing me of a similar sigthing. I'm now in my 30's an extremely active hunter, farmer and woodsman. I hunt deer 40 days a year in Maine, RI, CT and New Jersey. I use automated cameras which are triggered by heat. I've never seen a picture of a bigfoot on my film. I have seen pictures of deer on my 50 acre tract of land that I would never believe are there if I didn't see it on my film. I know every inch of my land and the surrounding property and these mystery deer show up at all hours on my cameras and frequently at that. How can they move right around our hunting parties in such a small area and never be seen, I'll never know, Even today I find it hard to accept what we definitely saw. I'm not a fan of ghosts, UFO's or even big foot. I'm not sure to this day what I saw wasn't a man in a costume, dressed up, out in rainstorm, a half mile or more from any home, waiting for my mother and me to drive down the road to give us a scare. The only thing I can say is it was a damn' good costume and a damn' good plan. We saw what we saw and this is something I would sware to on any polygraph test as I'm sure my mother would.\",\n",

After walking thirty to forty minutes down the main trail beginning from Great Neck Road, I took a smaller path off of the trail for about five minutes. That is when I noticed a young tree that was snapped in half at about six feet off the ground. More noteworthy, however, was a stick formation that I found a little bit farther down the path on a slightly elevated area of land. It was small, maybe three feet high, but constructed in the same woven-looking manner characteristic of other possible bigfoot stick formations. Other than that, I did not find anything else unusual. It may not be extremely compelling evidence, but I figured it was worth telling experts, who could then take it as far as they saw fit.\",\n",

The area is rural, but is populated and this particular area is in an open field that is in plain view of a well-traveled road.  Similar tracks appeared in the snow the following year.  Unfortunately I was too young to drive to the store for film and no one else in my family seemed to care about my findings.  Several years later, approximately 1993-1994, I had another strange experience on our small farm.  I never connected the two events until reading some other stories on your web-site.  One night I stepped out of our house into the car-port.  The car-port was brightly illuminated, but none of the other exterior lights were on.  This made it impossible to see outides the perimiter of the car-port.  As I stepped out of the house, something screamed at me from the darkness, a screma like I had never heard.  It was not human, it was too wild, but it sounded more human than animal.  It seemed to be both a warning and a scream of terror.  I was told that it was probably a wildcat, but never believed it to sound like a cat at all.  I wasn't aware that screaming was associated with bigfoot.  I am now wondering if the number of toes I mentioned earlier is in order?\",\n",

About 20 minutes went by and I see my son and his friend running towards the tractor out of breath..\\\"Dad,i don't care if you believe me or not but what we just saw...I never want to see again!\\\"..His friend said she saw it first. This is the story they have repeatedly told me all afternoon yesterday and this morning- They were walking the logging Rd,and my son started hearing these loud crashes in front of them to the right coming towards them,He said he stopped and felt \\\"Very uneasy\\\" about going any further,to which he told his friend \\\"he wasn't going any farther and she could if she wanted\\\"..She walked around the bend of the road,come walking fast back to him  and says \\\"There was this thing looking at me behind a tree,swaying left to right,as if to see what she was..It leaned as if to be curious..So, She,not wanting to show it any harm by running or sudden  movement,afraid it would chase her,just turned and walked fast back to my son,and told him \\\"There is something huge and black standing around the corner\\\"...My son started walking with her and turned back to see if he could see anything and it had came around the corner and was staring at them..He said it was between 7-8ft tall,had blackish/brown,almost like a turkeys feather color when the sun is not shining on its feathers, and had HUGE muscles showing through the fur,he especially notice how broad the shoulders were and how muscular the arms were.At that time they started running as fast as they could until they got to the field i was cutting.. I eventually got in my truck and drove to the spot/area they said this all happened..The woods were a \\\"dead quiet\\\"..No Tracks were found,i did not smell any foul odor,as i have heard this animal has, plus a storm was approaching so i had to get back and put the tractor up. My son,who is sitting beside me as i type this,says \\\"I just don't feel it meant any harm,it was puzzled as why we were there.\\\" There were men cutting hay on the next farm over which had not been done in quite a while.There is no hunting,no more cattle,that place is not disturbed at all,so maybe it came from there?? What makes me believe even more is that my son LOVES hunting and that farm,but now says he is not coming up unless he has protection(Gun)and will not walk the place alone.Whatever this was or whatever happened to them has changed them.The friend,which said she doesn't believe in Bigfoot,now is a firm believer. My son's words-\\\"It wasn't scared of us,but we sure were of it!\\\"\",\n",

One weekend in the spring my family and two others from the base went on a picnic. We traveled up in to the mountains off of hiway 89. We were in the Wasatch national forest, going toward the present day ski areas, only less developed at the time. There was snow on the higher peaks, but a pleasent day. The time was morning about 9:00 to 10:00 am. I couldn't wait to play in the mountains! When we arrived at our location, a open area just 100 yrds off the road, the adults started setting up the grill and setting up other things. I was with three other children around my age, and we ran off up the side of a large mountain. There we found an small open field and starting play hide-and go-seek. We were about 200 yds from our parents and there was no one else around, no cars, or other people. The area had a lot of smaller pines and scrub brush. We felt safe where we were. After 20 minutes or so we went up the mountain a little further and began playing. There was a small mound on the west side of where we were playing and I thought that would be a great spot to hide. As the counting began I ran around the mound and was trying to hide when, I got the feeling I was being watched. I turned around and about thirty feet from me, standing beside a large tree and bush was a very large creature.  It was just standing there watching me and I was looking at it. It didn't make any aggresive moves or sounds...it was just content watching me. It had reddish-brown long hair over its body. Dark eyes, and fairly tall. I slowly got up and started walking backward... our eyes locked on one another. Its like we both were in a trance or something. Some feeling inside of me told me this was not a safe situation and thats when I broke off the stare and ran as fast as I could. I ran right past my friends and started screeming all the way down the mountain. When I arrived at the picnic site, I was almost too excited to talk. I ran to my dad and told him what I saw and he and the other adults  agreed that I saw something... but perhaps only a deer or bobcat. My dad agreed to go back there to check this out. When we got back to the site...we of course found nothing, but later on as we were leaving the area, I happened to look up at the part of the mountain we were playing on and there it was again in the same spot...watching us leave! Before I could say anything, we rounded the corner and lost sight of it. For years after I was terrified of going in to forest alone. At the time of the incident there was no talk about bigfoot...It was not in the media and not on television. I just knew that I saw a strange creature. Years later I saw a photo or a drawing and it brought back this memory. I believe that this creature was watching us kids play and was very interested in us.\",\n",

      "  \"observed\": \"On Aug. 15, 1998, I sent the following E-mail to: ameyer@weber.edu After looking through a couple of Bigfoot web sites, I thought he might be the best one to send it to. Now after looking through your web site, I guess I should have looked a little further. Oh well, FYI here's a copy of my story. Dear Mr Meyer I want to tell you about what happened a very long time ago, 1968. I was living up Ogden canyon, in a house in Wheeler canyon, the second one to be exact. It was fall and there were alot of leaves on the ground. Very late one evening I was sitting in the living room watching TV, my 2 year old son was in the back bedroom asleep. The chair I was sitting in was angled with it's back to the windows. I got up to go into the kitchen to get a drink, when I turned around in the kitchen to walk back into the livingroom I was shocked to see a pair of glowing red eyes staring at me from the window behind my chair through the window. The porch light was also shining through that same window to the left (from my point of view) of the creatures head. All I could see of it was mainly a very dark mass outlined in the window and the eyes which were reflecting the light and seemed to glow red. I stood in the kitchen doorway frozen, I kept trying to tell myself I was seeing things and it wasn't really there. After all, I did enjoy monster movies, even though the show I was watching that night was a love story, I kept trying to convince myself it was just my imagination. I finally turned and put my back against the wall inside the kitchen doorway and told myself that I'd clear my mind and when I turned around again it would not be there. I waited long enough to compose myself and then turned back into the doorway to go into the living room. It didn't work, my visitor was still there! I want you to know that at that time in my life I had never heard of a bigfoot. The only thing in my mind that could look like that was a werewolf and, ofcourse, everyone knows they are only movie myth. I turned around again and walked back to the bedroom where my son was sleeping. I was very shaken and the only thing I could think to do was call the police. I dialed the operator and asked for the police but when they came on the line to talk to me they said because I was up the canyon I needed to talk to the sheriff. I finally got to talk to the sheriff's dept. and I told them I had a prowler. I certainly couldn't say I had a beast of some kind looking in my window. It took them about 30 to 45 minutes to show up at the house. While I waited, I sat in the dark and just listened, expecting to hear the thing crashing through the door or window at any time. I heard several of the windows along the east side of the house rattle \\\"softly\\\" and also the back door, as if someone was just testing to be sure they were secure. After that there was nothing but silence and I started to get some courage back before the sheriff showed up. By the time they got there I was back to the living room and waiting for them. They asked for a discription, and I said I couldn't see the person because they were standing on the top step next to the porch light and all I could see was a dark outline of their head and sholders in the window. One of the deputies was about my husbands height, 6'3' and he stood on the top step and the window framed only his head. They commented that my prowler must be fairly tall. There were no tracks to be found when I looked the next day, too many leaves. The porch doorway and steps at that time were built to go right along the house toward the driveway. Several years later when I went back to look at the house, someone had changed the door and stairs to go away from the house and out toward the lawn. It made me wonder if someone else had the same visitor. My husband had laughed at me at the time I told him about what had happened. I took my son and moved out about a week after that. My husband later told me that about a month or so after that he had a strange encouter early one morning. He was up getting ready for work when he heard a racket out in the porch so he went out to chase our cats out and stop the noise. As he walked toward the front door he saw a dark hairy face looking in at him through the little diamond shaped window in the door. He stoped and thought \\\"Bear\\\", and he ran into the front bedroom to put on his pants and grab his gun. By the time he got back out, he was alone again. It wasn't until later when he was thinking about it that he realised that it couldn't have been a bear because it's face was up close to the window and a bears snout would not fit close to the window like that. About a year after that, my husband moved to Eugene OR with a friend to work and he sent me a book on bigfoot with a note that said, \\\"I think you might like to read this, remember your visitor\\\".. Remember, I'll never forget, I still get the shakes when I think about it and it's been alot of years. One other note I'd like to mention; When we first moved to Wheeler canyon, we did so with another couple and they had 3 horses which they kept in a corral down by the creek. More than once, when I was there alone in the evenings I would hear the horses screeming. I'm not talking just their normal horse neigh or such, I'm talking screeming. I told Bob about it and he said \\\"Oh don't worry about it, either the mare is picking on one of the boys or they can sense a wild cat up in the clifs\\\". After my visitor, I think what the horses could sense or smell was not a wild cat. I've told this story to alot of friends and family, but never reported it to anyone involved in the study or tracking of bigfoot before. I hope that you find this of some interest, I picked your address to send it to because of your location and the fact that this took place close to where you are. I now live with my second husband in WA but most of our familys are still in the Ogden area. I don't know how long they keep police report records, especially such minor type reports but maybe they keep them forever. I have no wish for any harm to come to any bigfoot. Thinking back, I know that the one I had the privlege to see ment me no harm. However, at the time, it sure scared the heck out of me.\",\n",

      "  \"observed\": \"This story I am going to relate happened some 15 1/2 years ago. I have never talked to anyone about it. Not even my wife, who I've been married to for almost 18 years. She is a very skeptical person, and is a hard person to convince of anything. She knows that I believe Bigfoot exists, because I have talked to her about Bigfoot before. She is just so skeptical about it, that I know she would think I was nuts if I ever told her my story. But after having visited your web site many times in the past, and seeing the new documentary on the discovery channel \\\"Sasquatch legend meets science\\\". I now feel like I would like to tell my story. I was deer hunting in the beautiful Wasatch Mountains about 4 1/2 to 5 miles east of Pineview Reservoir in the Cache National Forest. I arrived at the magpie campground around 10:00 am. As far as I could tell, I was the only one at the campground, although the campground goes a lot farther east than I was. I parked at the furthest west parking lot, and from there I crossed the bridge that takes you over the south fork of the Ogden River. After crossing the river there is a trail that goes east, and parallels the river. I followed the trail until it branches off. At that point the trail goes south through a small canyon. The day was so nice, and I was enjoying the sounds and the scenery very much. About halfway through the canyon I made a great effort to stay as quiet as I could, because I didn't want to alert anything to my presents there. The trail up the canyon goes for a ways, I can't remember how far, but then it turns and goes west. Right after it turns, everything opens up a little bit more, and there are steep slopes on either side. Not long after I made this turn, I herd this noise. It was a noise that I had never heard before. A low grunting sort of growling type of noise. But what was amazing to me about it was the immense volume of the sound. I could almost feel the volume. I'm not sure if I can put the sound into words, but it was something like \\\"huuuuuuurrrrruuu\\\". The sound was a low-pitched sound, but it would drop off even lower at the end. I stopped immediately in my tracks, and scanned the slope to my right, which was were the sound had come from. The sound continued again, but I couldn't locate the exact spot. I just stood there, and listened. The noise kept repeating, but I wasn't able to find it. So I continued on up the trail very slowly. The noise was not continuous; there were pauses of maybe a minute or two. Then I would hear the noise again. A moose was the only thing that came to mind as the source of the sound. I didn't really care to have a confrontation with a moose so I stayed on guard, as I got closer to the sound. After going a little further up the trail I herd the noise again. This time my eyes were able to lock on to the location. Up the steep slope to my right about a hundred feet up and probably 350 to 400 feet in front of me there was a growth of thick trees and brush. The noise was coming from in that spot. I felt a little bit better; at least I knew were the thing was. I was far enough away from it that I thought if I make some noise maybe it would leave. So I start stepping on branches and kicking small rocks, but it did not leave. I kept going up the trail thinking I would see it soon, but it would not show its self. Finally I was right beneath it, about a hundred feet straight below the thick covered area. I stopped at a tree below the sound, and sat there on a thick branch. I was pretty sure that what ever was up there knew I was right down below it. Then the sounds became more agitated. I was trying real hard to see into the thick covered area using my binoculars. But I could not see into it at all. Then along with the noise some tree branches in the thick area started shacking. They were shacking about 9 or 10 feet up off the ground. I then thought o.k. here it comes. But it still wouldn't come out. I started to feel a little uneasy. I just knew that I was being watched, and what ever was watching me did not want me there. The noise started to intensify ever more. I just could not believe the lung capacity this thing had. The noise was immense. Then I really became unnerved when two rocks, about the size of basketballs came rolling out of the thick cover, down towards me. That's all I needed. I got back up and immediately headed out the way I had come. I didn't run or do anything to cause a disturbance. I just walked out as calmly and quickly as I could. I kept checking my back though to make sure I was not being followed. I could still here the noise until I got back around the bend in the trail. As soon as I got around the corner, my anxieties and fears left, And I felt all right again. I just knew that what ever I heard wanted me to leave. I was only too happy to oblige. I have hunted and fished by myself for years, and felt very comfortable by myself in those situations. But I have never heard anything at all like what I heard that day. I still don't know what was in that thick area of tree and brush growth, and I'm not sure if you will find this at all interesting. But I have read accounts where a Bigfoot would remain hid while being looked at, or while it is looking at someone. Well this was a lot of years ago, and I know that's its nothing that can be checked out now. But maybe it would help with research. Thank you for your time.\",\n",

By the time we were to pass it my brother-in-law rolled down his window and yelled \\\"get out of the road!\\\" my sister asked what do you think that was and my brother in-law said \\\"it was probably some kid dressed in a gorilla suit\\\" but as we thought about it, it did not make sense because there were no cars and there was no where to park other than the top. And after we yelled at it, it just walked up into the mountains. I know that I saw something that was about 8 ft tall very dark and hairy my only conclusion is that it was bigfoot\",\n",

      "  \"observed\": \"The sighting happened during the bow hunting season in Utah. I liked to hunt the area because of the relative isolation and the numerous deer. I had been hiking around the area of what is know as: Six-Bit Springs. I did start out in a general direction but wove around so much that I did not really know where I was (it would be hard for me to point it out on a map). The first strange thing I noticed was the absence of large game, it is usally a game highway in that part of the woods. As I was wandering, getting totally lost, I noticed a reeking smell and decided to scout out the source (I was curious if a hunter had lost or shot deer or elk during the hunt and wanted to see what it was). I would catch whiffs of the smell here and there and it led me to a sort of clearing. The area looked like a dried out pond. The grass was greener in this area and compared to the woods the only area that had bright sunlight. I scanned the general area and nothing really caught my eye except for what I thought was a large tree stump almost in the middle of the pond (about 25-35 yards from where I was standing in the trees). As I was walking back up the slope the smell hit me again and it was coming from the pond area. I looked again and stared at what I thought was a tree stump, it was black, like it had been burned by lighting or fire. The shape was odd, it was roughly pear shaped and contoured,no jagged edges like broken piece of wood, it looked like a large person wrapped in a dark shawl sitting with their back to you. In this sitting position it might have been about 4 feet tall. As I stared at it I decided it was only a burned tree stump that had weathered smooth edges, but as I watched it listed to one side. It was then I thought it might be a black cow or a moose laying with it's back to me. As I watched, it would shift back and forth like someone getting comfortable in their seat. I also noticed the grasses in front of this thing moving as though they were being disturbed. It seemed to be very intent on what it was doing. I became scared at this point and hurried back up the slope and after many wrong turns here and there I made my way back to camp about 4:00-4:30PM. The only other strange thing that happened was the large dog we always took camping and hunting was very jumpy and nervious, and would run off into the wooded areas by our camp for no apparent reason and would stare and fixate on the woods for very long peroids of time. The reason I mention this is that this same dog has been on these trips numerous times and he has never acted this way. Needless to say we left at the crack of dawn the next morning and I have not been back to the site since then. I don't know if this story is worth keeping because I could not guarantee that it was not a cow or moose although being familiar with cows and seeing moose often, I strongly doubt that it was either of these.\",\n",

It was kind of late in the day, around 7 p.m. He usually does a perimeter walk of the property when he gets there and on this particular occasion, he had stopped down by the creek. He said he smelled this horrible smell that he had never smelled before. He described it as rotten meat and really bad B.O. He searched around the area and didn't see any tracks because the ground was really rocky. Where he was at, there is a big tree that has fallen over the creek. It's big enough for two people to walk over side by side. My grandfather hopped up on the tree and he said there were droppings right in the middle of it. He said he thought it might be elk droppings, but thought how on earth would an elk get up on this tree. When he told me the story, I told him that there was a bigfoot in his vicinity, that's where the smell was coming from. I read a lot of articles and a lot of people describe almost the same kind of smell. He also stated that our apple tree at the property doesn't have any apples on it anymore, and there are no chokecherries to be seen anymore. We usually have lots of apples and chokecherries. The deer and elk never eat them all. And the only apples they eat are the one's that fall on the ground. The rest are to high up the tree for them to get to. It would even be hard for a full grown moose to get the apples from the tree.\",\n",

      "  \"observed\": \"At approximately 10 pm one night, my wife and I returned home from a shopping trip. Upon opening the car door and stepping into the gravel driveway I heard a distinct and loud vocalization. It wasn't a howl, not a growl, nothing I had heard before which is what caught my attention. At 31 years old now, 28 then, I had spent my life in the outdoors, locally and abroad. I have never heard anything to match this. My wife asked me what it was and I had to admit I didn't know, but perhaps it was a big cat. But it didn't sound like a cat, and the only cats in the area that are known as 'big' would be bobcats, a big one being 18-29 lbs. I walked inside the house, cutting on the rear porch light, and walked through the house to the front deck where I walked back outside, cutting on the front deck light. I stood at the end of the deck facing east and listened intently. The 'cries' were coming from a ridge in a large woodlot across the railroad tracks behind our house. Our house is situated on 10 acres, and the rear property boundary is the railroad. At that time the nearest house to us, a couple of hundred yards to the east was uninhabited, but the next houses up and across the railroad tracks were. Between cries, I realized I could hear leaves rustling loudly as though two feet were shuffling through them in large strides. When the leaves stopped making noise, an agitated cry was heard. This went on for a minute or two, then the noises came from closer to the neighboring houses, then it started going in the other direction. I probably listened for ten minutes total, until could no longer hear the leaves moving, and howls were coming from farther away. It was mid fall and cold, the sky was clear, no traffic on the road in front of my house which intersects with the railroad maybe a quarter mile down the road. I have labored under the impression that the cries came from some kind of cat, but after listening to the Ohio recording, the cries I heard were frightfully akin to the howls on that recording. They were shorter and sounded more agitated as though something was making the 'issuer' of the cries mad. The large woodlot across the tracks is semi-surrounded by a loose assortment of houses in a neighborhood, which could be easily walked through unseen in the dark. Everything else for surrounding areas is farm pasture and mountain, in fact one mile from my house to the east starts a gravel road running across a mountain into the next county. My inside dogs were whining and agitated, but never offered to bark, then, they rarely do. However neighborhood dogs could be heard barking in the distance, beagles I know for sure and a German Shepherd.\",\n",

I was brisk fully walking backwards and pulled my knife out I was in fear for my life from what I saw whatever it was stood I say around 7 to 8 ft tall I only saw the silhouette of it it was very tall and very broad across the shoulders, I saw it for about 3 to 4 seconds and ran to my left with incredible speed and I ran to the truck in fear for my life. On a later incident I was carp fishing near the river behind the fish hatchery again, I had 2 other friends with me I will not mention any of my friends names because they don't want to be included in what happened, and something threw what I believe was a rock at us I was scared but we left a few hours later because I was getting worried.\",\n",

      "  \"observed\": \"I research mountain lions in NH, but I was caring for my mother and hadn't gotten out since Christmas Day, 2014. On 5/24/15 I decided to just go for a walk, no research. I did a Meet-up with someone who walked much faster than me. She left me at the power line. I was way downhill, but was determined to at least make it to the power line. I did, but when I turned back to go down to the car, I saw two huge prints near a tree by the trail. When I got to them, the heels were 3-4 inches deep in the soil and leaves. They touched and the toes went out and away from each other like a duck's feet. They seemed to be 15 inches long, but it was hard to tell with all the leaves, unevenness, grass, etc. I took photos and measurements (even on a walk I take a camera and tape measure). It was interesting as hiding by that tree the Futures Trail went right past the tree, above was the power line and behind the tree was the park road, so that it was an advantageous hunting spot as animals coming from six different directions could easily be hunted down. Going back to the car, I saw two more tracks to the right of the trail. One was about 10 inches. The other seemed to be 15 inches, but with a 10 inch track inside it. The toes were 5 inches across for the three toes that were embedded in the bank. The other toes were over the hardened trail. There was also a 5x6 inch parallelogram shape. I kick myself now as I didn't take a photo. Later I saw a knuckle-walking gorilla on TV and thought, \\\"That's what that was!\\\" It was a knuckle print and also was very deep. At the bottom I asked the ranger to do a casting and he said I could instead, so I bought plaster of Paris. It wasn't enough. I had to go back several days later (rain). The casts are awful. There were too many leaves, the toes broke off, etc. The interesting part was that the park ranger acknowledged the report with a \\\"Yeah, we get lots of reports of bigfoots, but we try to keep it on the down low.\\\" When I asked him about mountain lion sightings, he seemed scared and said, \\\"You think there are mountain lions up there?\\\" It was odd that bigfoot was \\\"normal\\\" and mountain lions were \\\"strange\\\"! When I came back, I heard from someone else that this same ranger had been followed down the hill by something he nicknamed Roy. He was hoping it was a bigfoot and not a lion. Part of his job is to clear the trails and make sure everyone is off the mountain. That night it got dark, and he was also \\\"helped\\\" off the mountain, though \\\"it\\\" always stayed the same distance behind him.\",\n",

We had driven some miles up into the hills when we found a partial clearing where we could park and enjoy ourselves. This was when we were engaged in 1941 and were just graduated from Grandview High School in Grandview, Washington. We stayed for part of the day at that spot. In the afternoon we had decided to leave. We had packed up and loaded the Ford with our stuff and were turning out of the clearing to go back to Grandview. As we were leaving I turned to see if we had left anything behind us and noticed something black moving in the clearing next to where we had parked. What I saw was a tall black creature covered with hair and very muscular walking quickly across the clearing parallel to us towards the forest. I said to your father, 'Look, whats that,' and pointed behind him at the creature. He slowed the car back down and looking where I pointed he said he didn't see anything. By the time he had slowed the car and looked the creature had dissapeared into the forest. I was the only one that saw it. When I told him what I had seen he said it was only a bear looking for berries to eat probably. I didn't want to argue with him as we were close to getting married and I didn't want to ruin a great outing and throw cold water on what had been a beautiful trip.\",\n",

Looking down at the river, as I always do to see deer or Bald Eagles, I saw a large dark figure at the edge of the water behind some bushes. Slamming on my brakes and backing up far enough to see the river again, the large figure was gone and no where to be seen. Of course my kids said, \\\"Sure Mom, Bigfoot...I don't think so\\\". About 2 weeks later I was driving on the same road coming home from Yakima in the evening. About a half mile from where I thought I had seen the other one, there were two standing side by side just looking down at the water. One was about a foot and a half taller than the other, both dark in color with very wide shoulders. And again by the time I stopped and backed up, there was nothing to be seen.\",\n",

      "  \"observed\": \"I will begin by saying that I am an avid extreme hunter and outdoorsman as is my companion on this trip.  We have hunted together for many years through all sorts of terrain and conditions, and have developed a certain uncanny sense for each other and the mountain. Normally I would not entertain writing this, but I have again been awaken by the re-occuring dream/nightmare of this mis-adventure.  The incident began after some brutal unsuccessful elk hunting on the Bethal Ridge above the Oak creek.  We are both local and know the mountain better than most. We decided to head over to the Cowiche were I had tagged a nice young bull the year before. The area supports a fair local herd and is extremely rugged. We had access to an area through a friend that owned some property and lived a very primitive lifestyle up there. Frank is his name and being a little eccentric his tales of bigfoot and not being caught on Divide ridge after dark were scoffed at by myself and hunting partner Justin. Anyway, we headed straight up the ridge in my hunting rig in late afternoon to pitch camp. We encountered three other rigs coming back down as the sun was setting. They were driving at a high rate of speed. I new one of the guys, he's a logger up there, and he stopped to warn us of the Divide Ridge after dark deal. I said thanks, see ya, and he proceeded back down the mountain, fast. Justin commented about being a bunch of wimps. We found a fair sight to spend the night. As some weather was coming in, we picked the heavily wooded very dense north slope to put out our bedrolls. The place had an eerie feel to it and I dismissed it as being in my head. We were gathering wood by flashlight for a fire when we both stopped and simultanously looked at each other. \\\"You smell that?\\\" \\\"Yeh, it's probably a couger kill\\\". A very strong rancid odor, not like rotting meat decay, just a putrid smell. We got a fire going and I put on a pot of venison chili. Justin started building the fire bigger and bigger. This was uncommon for him. I asked him. He stated \\\"something ain't right up hear tonight\\\" and I said I agree. We both know fear feeds on fear and dismissed it at that. Then we heard the first whistle/howl. The first one was distant and we could here clearly due to no wind and the cold. When elk call each other, people not familier with wapiti can mis-interpret these calls as whistles. This was no elk. Justin got out his cow elk call and responded with a short set of chirps. I got out my Weatherby and .44 Magnum. Something was not right. There was no initial response to Justin's cow calls. I put some more wood on the fire. Then came the second shrill howl, in the creek bottom right below us. It was loud and like nothing else we have ever heard and believe me when I tell you we have hunted every manner of \\\"known\\\" species in these mountains. My hair was literally standing on end. Justin said \\\"we're outta here right now, cover me, I'm pitching camp\\\". He started packing tarps and gear while I sat listening and watching, heavily armed. Justin is one of the most fearless men I have ever met. He was white with fear. Next thing we heard was feet walking in the snow, very loud crunching. Justin just about knocked me over getting to my rifle. The scarey part is, we have crashed enough hooved ungulates through the woods to know the sound of four legs crunching snow. This was very deliberate walking, not crashing or running. I screamed out that we were locked and loaded and who ever is out there to come into the light, hoping someone would. The crunching snow stopped. Now both Justin and I are very seasoned and responsible hunters and probably the last ones to shoot at noises in the dark, but this had gone far beyond that. There was something standing out there in the dark, large and not scared of us, which for any manner of \\\"known\\\" species in our mountains is unusual.  This silent standoff went on for about two minutes. We could see nothing outside the light of the fire and lanterns. Now mind you this creature was close enough that we could hear it walking in the snow, so we knew it was still there, but there was no smell. I called out one more time and we fired one shot from my pistol into the air. Then all hell broke lose. There was a loud short grunt and running feet crunching in the snow, and we started firing reloading and firing. We did not stop shooting till we were loaded and well on our way. After a harrowing drive off the mountain at night in the snow, which I do not reccommend to even experienced drivers, we made it back to the my ranch. My wife took one look at us and knew something was truely wrong. Justin refused to talk the whole drive off the mountain. And to this day refuses to talk about it. I have no desire to go back up Divide Ridge to investigate. It is 3:00 A.M. and I'm am writing this after I was awaken again by this same incident. I am still an avid hunter, but I stick to Bethal Ridge. Make no mistake, this incident has changed my perspective. I would encourage anyone interested in this to spend some time on Divide Ridge, good luck.\",\n",

      "  \"observed\": \"While on a family camping trip this summer, my husband, our two teenage boys, and our two Newfoundland dogs headed out towards Naches where my husband often hunts. We don't like \\\"organized\\\" camping, so we headed towards Bumping Lake in the Mt Baker/Snoqualmie National Forest. We had got a late start, and arrived at the lake about 8:00 pm. We continued on past the camping area at the dam about 4 or 5 miles towards the \\\"Deep Creek\\\" area, hoping for a secluded camping spot by the lake. We turned off on a four-wheel drive trail about a mile from Deep Creek. Found a campsite next to a swamp, and as it was getting late and almost dark, we decided to camp. After setting up camp, about 10:00 pm, our dogs went absolutely nuts, barking and very excited...a few minutes later, a car arrived looking for a camp site, but turned and left. The dogs definitly heard this car well before we did, and did their job annoucing the presence of this \\\"intruder.\\\" We fired up the campfire and ate a late dinner, while getting comfortable with our surroundings. It was a mild night, it had been hot and dry for some time. About midnight our two boys headed off to bed. Our big male Newfoundland was chained to a tree about 5 yards away from the campsite. Our female Newf was at our feet, as usual. It was extremely quite where we were. My husband and I were sitting by the campfire relaxing when, out of the swamp beside us, not more than 100 to 200 feet away came a noise, a screem or a grunt that changed pitch to a screech and then ended in a grunt-huffing sound, lasting a long time. The dogs had not reacted at all until they heard this scream, when they went wild. My husband is a logger and advide hunter-outdoorsman, so I turned to him and asked \\\"what was that?\\\" From the look of his eyes and on his face, I knew that he did not know what it was. He has heard the voices of about every animal in the Pacific Northwest at some time in 30 plus years of being in the woods. Our oldest son came out of the tent and asked if \\\"someone was messing with us.\\\" He thought it sounded very human-like. Please remember that there was absolutely no noise, ie sticks or brush breaking or moving prior to the scream, and the dogs didn't detect anything around us, and they were extremely on edge in their new surroundings. We got the dogs settled down and began discussing possibilities of what was out there. All was quite about 15 minutes later, when we heard what sounded like two sticks being hit together about 100 yards north of the original scream. The dogs once again went nuts. About another 15 minutes went by when we heard this same noise of sticks being hit together, this time farther away, about 300 yards north and the dogs once again did their thing. Whatever it was had moved silently through the brush in the swamp, apparently downwind from us as the dogs detected no movement between the noises. About an hour later we found ourselves in the middle of a dry-lighting storm and heard no more unusal sounds. The following morning my husband and sons went on a search of the area and found no tracks or broken brush around the swamp. We promptly packed up and moved to Deep Creek!\",\n",

It was about 10:30pm and we had just finished cleaning up after dinner. All of us goofed off for awhile running through the dark woods with flashlights, just exploring. After getting our fill of that, we built a fire in our fire-pit and were just relaxing and talking. Suddenly, we heard a horrific scream coming from behind us on what I think was Nelson Ridge. It was a long, high-pitched bellow that instantly caught our attention. The scream was a classic sasquatch scream, trying to catch the attention of another. About 15 seconds later, we heard another roar come back from down-range from what I think was Miners Ridge. We were all petrified and instantly knew what it was. Things settled down and we ended up going to bed. My nephew and I were up, decidedly exited about what we heard. We were laying in our tent, just talking. Suddenly, we heard another scream. Both of us grabbed our hand-guns at that point. We weren't sure what was going to happen. Eventually we fell asleep and nothing else happened. We are planning a trip back to Bumping Lake, specifically to look for what we heard.\",\n",

I was Elk hunting in the Bumping river area of Yakima County. I was walking up the American ridge trail in the am Hours. I had reached a portion of the the trail that was flat and had soft dirt. I noticed a foot print on the trail. My first thought was why would someone walk barefooted up on the mountain. The track was not large. It looked like a slender womans foot print. I followed the track up the trail for about six to eight feet and I then lost sight of the track. I continued walking and I heard a wierd whistling sound. It wasn't real loud, but I definetly didn't recognize it. I started to put things together in my mind (Track/Whistle) and the hair on the back of my neck stood up. I continued up the trail and eventually sat down to watch a draw for any elk that may be crossing. I again heard the whistling sound. I have been hunting in this exact area since about 1977 including other places and I don't recall hearing a similair sound. Looking back now, It seems even more strange that if the foot print was in fact a person that had taken off their shoes to fix their socks or whatever, why would they walk up the trail, especially in late October?\",\n",

As usual the relatives were around the campfire till late at night (1:00 a.m.) cracking jokes and making the most racket around, long after other area camps shut off their noisy generators. Believed this attracted it's couriousity. The relatives (3) who witnessed the sounds are very experienced outdoorsmen. One worked in the Northwest woods as a surveyor and has been chased by bears a couple of times (One time his co-worker had his pack ripped from his back as they ran) and all three know the sounds animals make. What they heard was NOT something like a Bear or Cougar! They are braver than most, not easily frightened by anyone or anything! The night of the incident was quiet and cold . . . about 2:30 a.m. one relative went outside the tent to relieve himself. As usual, he shined his flashlight around the perimeter of the camp. As the light beam went close to the creature, it let out a VERY LOUD and LONG Volcalization as it ran through the dense timber. The noise was very intense and continious without breaking branches along the way and again 3/4 mile up the high ridge. It seemed to be mad for almost being spotted and made the sound as it ran as though it was without effort. Comparable to a kids loud car stereo turned on with the volume already up and was steady for 10 - 12 seconds. The second time up the ridge could have been from another creature but sounded like the same one. It would have easily beaten any person up the heavily timbered and steep ridge. It was defenetly NOT any known animal like a Bear bellaring as it ran or a cougar. The noise was so loud it woke up three camps about 1/4 mile apart. The relatives left a gas lantern on until it burned out each night afterwards and they went out with a loaded gun or second person with their loaded gun. None of them will EVER sleep on the ground again! That week of hard hunting, the 14 other hunters in the area didn't see any Elk or Deer. Also did not hear any coyotes! Seemed like everthing was frightened away, very unusual. There was no sign in the hard frozen ground or up the high ridge the next day.\",\n",

Near the yakima river matter of fact we were so close to the river that in the spring when the river rose we had to move the animals an go into town .the woods were thick we had a pig pen it was a long ways away from the house really thickly wooded. all the time we lived there you wood hear shrill whistling whistling in the bushes at this time we were maybe ten years old never heard of bigfoot before im 48 years old now so it was long ago.It was in the ninteen sixtys way before roger patterson nobody knew about bigfoot . Well anyway us kids were sent into the woods to feed the cows at the big pond . We had two cows we had a little wagon with a bail of hay on it .We left it there for them to eat we left and stopped by the river to talk. Four of us kids we were all looking the same way when all of a sudden 30 feet away something something stepped from the clearing in full view of us took one step maybe six feet an dissapeared behind a bush it was id say eight feet tall hairy it took one step and was gone .We alllooked at each other an ran home nobody beleived us the said it may have been a hunter or something . that was the end of it . It was years later that i learned what it really was .I was 40 years old looking in a library when i saw something about it and what i read told of sightings of bigfoot in the same place where we lived the same years we lived there. It didnt try to chase us we were kids it could have caught us easily but i think it was just watching us . I also reamember my aunt going to kook for us kids at anoughter time at the pig pen we came home anighter way she came running up out of breath she heard a loud whistle behind her in the bushes i remmber hearing those all the time even in the daytime they were so shrill. Once my aunt was alone at the house at night she came out side to get into the car to pick us up in town she herd the shrill whistle behind her next to the house she tore out out of there so fast she drove right therw the loced fence. all of this is true he does exist i saw him . I have other stories to tell im half indian i spent my whole life in the yakima valley.\",\n",

I glanced in my rearview mirror and saw a very large upright creature step to the middle of the road. I immediatly slowed down and quickly glanced around for a safe spot to pull over and there wasn't one I looked back over my shoulder through my canopy window and saw that the creature was still standing in the middle of the road. There was still a lot of dust in the air from where I had passed and all I could make out was that What I was looking at was very tall maybe (7 to 8 feet) and broad it also was very dark in color. The arms appeared to be held out slightly from the sides and reached to about mid thigh. when I reached a full stop the creature seemed to pivot on its left leg while swinging its arms turned to the left and took one step to the opposite side of the road and disapeared from view. When I looked at the area where it crossed I was unable to discern any tracks in the gravel that I could definately say were footprints. The area where the creature went off the road is very steep and rocky. I would not want to try going down it without ropes and I doubt if what I saw was another hunter out scouting since the hill ends in a cliff just a few hundred yards down.\",\n",

      "  \"observed\": \"First off I am not a true beliver in BigFoot.  I was messing around on the internet and stumbled apon your site.  I thought it would be funny to see what sightings have happend around my home city of Yakima Washington.  When I clicked on the report form of the July 2000 (class B) hearing sound around bumping lake, I got the chills.  Let me start from the begining.  Myself and a couple of buddies of mine took off from Yakima really late with the intent of climbing the trail and spending 3 days of camping at Twin Sisters. We were going to stay at the first lake (Or First Sister).  The lake is about 8 or 9 miles past bumping lake and you have to hike in about 1-1.25 miles straight up. When we arrived at the lake after taking way to long to climb the trail (Over confident and over packed) we set up came and got the fire going by 12:30am-1:00am.  We were exhausted and really didn't feel like drinking or anything else but eating and going to bed.  About two hours after going to bed I was awoken by some little grunting sounds.  I woke up kind of starteld but then realized they were basically a quarter the way around the lake so I just sat and listened.  All of a sudden they turned from little gruntings to a grunt/scream.  I quietly called out my friends Shawns name and he had been woken up and was listening to.  I asked him what the hell that was and after talking about it we both convinced ourselves that it was an elk or something.  I am not an animal call expert by any means but to this day when I think about that trip one of the first things I think about is how weird that sounded.  I have heard elk and deer grunts before but this sounded different. As Ron White would say \\\"I told you that story so I could tell you this one.\\\" On the last night I slow cooked some stakes over the fire coals for about.  When they were done my friends and I were enjoying them when were heard something about 60 or 70 yards out from camp.  We were camped out below the rocky base of the mountain top.  Its like the dirt stops and the rocks go up the rest of the way.  The sound was coming from the rocky area but we all thought it was a cat or bear so we got up grabbed the guns and an axe and started out with a lantern to go see what the hell was out there.  The sound was like what a rock being thrown and hitting the other rocks and then coming to rest.  It didn't sound like a little rock slide and it happen several times until we got closer, infact we had barehanded our stakes and finished them while we were away from camp as close to the sounds as we could get without climbing the rocky face, they completely stopped.  At no time did we every think it was bigfoot but we couldn't figure out what would make a sound like that?  It didn't sound like an animal that was mearly passing by, it moved to quick and to speratic(as if someone was throwing at different targets.  The only reason I look back on it now is that I was watching a bigfoot special today on the history channel and they had a gentlemen on there saying bigfoot was throwing rocks at him.  And now looking back I could definatley see how someone or something throwing a rock down twords us could make that sound.  Were the activity was would be the exact place I would be if I wanted to mess with my buddies back at camp.  We always talk about those noises and never ever gave bigfoot a chance of being the sorce of the sounds and now I just don't know.  After all this time of not even considering it now that I think of that as a possiblity it makes more and more sence even though I don't truely believe in Bigfoot.\",\n",

We had already been through Yellowstone, on a cross country trip and had been on the lookout for wildlife all through our driving, so my wife was very sure of what she saw. She had been good about picking out Antelope, Deer, and a Grizzly bear on earlier days during our trip. We were proceeding up the mountain pass, and were in the middle of the switchbacks when my wife saw what she described as \\\\\\\"A man in dark clothes\\\\\\\" on the side of the road on an upcoming part of the pass. She was visibly surprised that the \\\\\\\"Man\\\\\\\" was not there as we turned the corner where he would have been. There were steep cliffs on each side of the road, with no turnouts and very little shoulder. She told me that she was paying attention as we rounded the switchback were he would have been so she could warn me about the man on the side of the road.\\\", \\\"ALSO_NOTICED\\\": \\\"Nothing\\\", \\\"OTHER_WITNESSES\\\": \\\"There was one passenger in the car and a driver.
